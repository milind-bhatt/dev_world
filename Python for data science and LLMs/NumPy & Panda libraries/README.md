## NumPy and Panda libraries

-	Numpy is third party library, enables high performance numerical computing.
-	It is faster than Python's built-in containers + computationally more efficient.

-	Panda library is also third party library.
-	Built on top of numPy 
-	Easy to use for machine learning and data visualization
-	Pandas has “series”-one dimensional array and “data frame”-two dimensional array
-	Indexing in Pandas: it is list of integers or labels, used to uniquely identify rows or columns.
-	[] is used for indexing.
