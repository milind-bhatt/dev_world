Topic 2: Execution Context & Call Stack
Understanding how JavaScript runs your code internally is critical to mastering advanced concepts like hoisting, closures, and async behavior.

📌 What is an Execution Context?
An execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

There are 3 types:

Global Execution Context (GEC)

Created when your script starts

One per program

this refers to the global object (like window in browsers)

Function Execution Context (FEC)

Created whenever a function is called

Each has its own arguments, local variables, and this

Eval Execution Context (rarely used, and discouraged)

📌 Two Phases of Execution
Every execution context goes through:

Creation Phase

Memory is allocated for variables and functions

var is hoisted (set to undefined)

let and const are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone)

this is set

Execution Phase

Code is executed line by line

Variables are assigned values

Functions are invoked

🧠 Example with Hoisting
js
Copy
Edit
console.log(x); // undefined
greet();        // "Hello!"

var x = 10;
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
Behind the scenes, JavaScript does this:

js
Copy
Edit
// Creation Phase (hoisting)
var x = undefined;
function greet() { console.log("Hello!"); }

// Execution Phase
console.log(x); // undefined
greet();        // Hello!
x = 10;
📌 Call Stack (Execution Stack)
The call stack is where execution contexts are pushed and popped:

js
Copy
Edit
function first() {
  second();
}
function second() {
  console.log("Second!");
}
first();
🧱 Call stack looks like:

sql
Copy
Edit
| second()         |
| first()          |
| Global Context   |
When second() finishes, it’s popped off the stack, then first(), then the program ends.

🔥 Common Errors:
Stack Overflow: Too much recursion

js
Copy
Edit
function recurse() {
  recurse();
}
recurse(); // ❌ Maximum call stack size exceeded
✅ Summary:
Concept	Purpose
Execution Context	Container for running code
Call Stack	Tracks function calls
Hoisting	Variables/functions moved to the top
this in context	Depends on how function is called
