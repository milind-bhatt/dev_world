Regression:
Statistical method, used to predict continuous outcome based on value of one or more variables.

### Types of regression:
1) Linear regression- relation between input and output variable is linear. 
==> simple linear regression: only single input is used to predict an output.
==> multiple linear regression: more then one input is used to predict an output.   

2) Non-linear regression: output is model by a function, which is non-linear combination of inputs.

Example of linear regression is predicting house price, based on different features like area, facilities, etc.
